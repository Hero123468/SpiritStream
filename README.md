# Spirit Stream

This project is so that I can press "play" and listen to my devotional plan like songs on a playlist.

Example:  
A simple full-stack Bible app built to practice React, Express, and MongoDB basics.

---

## Why this exists

I created this because my devotional is one of the few things maintaining my sanity.  I also thought others might enjoy using it
if I can get it functional, and possibly even polished. I'm trying to clear the cobwebs off my education and build a web app wjere
React frontend talks to an Express API and data flows to and from MongoDB.
